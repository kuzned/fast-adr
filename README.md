# Fast Analog-to-Digital Recorder

*Analog-to-digital recorder (ADR) for data acquisition of single-event fast-flowing processes*

Fast ADR is an electronic acquisition device using four 50 MSa/s flash analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with time-interleaved sampling to record single-shot analog waveforms at a total sample rate of 200 MSa/s. The samples digitized by the ADCs then are temporarily stored in a buffer static memory before sending to a PC through the CAMAC bus controller.

## Main features

* Sampling rate: 200 MHz
* Sampling period: 5 ns
* Resolution: 6-bit
* Input dynamic range: 5V
* Input impedance: 50 Ohm
* Buffer RAM: 256 x 6-bit
* Main logic: ECL
* Interface: CAMAC bus
* Design: CAMAC module 2M-wide
* PCB: single-board 2-layer

## Background

The module was developed for the Institute of Electrophysics of the Ural Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union to acquire the events occurring in high-current pulse devices, where typical process looks like an explosion of microseconds range.

The device was presented at the International Symposium on Problems of Modular Information Computer Systems and Networks.
